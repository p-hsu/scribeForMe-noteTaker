## Project overview

This application is a note taker, allowing the user to record, save, and access notes/tasks in one place. Simple and easy to use, get ready to have a personal scribe for you!

### Project Status:

This project is completed and functional.

#### Issues to debug:
* `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]` : fixed function for API app.get route : RESOLVED

* New notes were saved but not posted on the page, Chrome Devtools helped to show that `server.js` was not linked : `app.use(express.static('public'));` : RESOLVED

* Saved notes not deleting, cleaned code up using variable to declare pathfile : 

    `  let dbPath = path.join(__dirname, './db/db.json')`

    ...to be used in the following...

    ```
        fs.writeFile(dbPath, JSON.stringify(db), (err) => {
        err ? console.error(`FAILED TO WRITE >>>>`, err) : console.log(`New note saved!`)
        });
    ```
    : RESOLVED
